
The app is making it possible to search for specific movies, songs, and upcoming concerts of specified artists.

The app requires the data needed, such as specifed npm packages and api-keys in order to run efficeintly and output accurate information.

To run the app you must simply type in "node liri.js" followed by any of the following commands depending on which function you're trying utilize, "concert-this", "spotify-this-song", or "movie-this" and the name of the artist, movie, or song. 
A written example looks like this: 
node movie-this I am Legend
The app will then return all of the basic relevant information of the movie.

Deployed app:

Technologies Used:
Used back-end node.js and the terminal provided to download several NPM packages such as axios.
I used several API's through axios using search and get requests.

I was the only developer working on the app and built it from scratch.
